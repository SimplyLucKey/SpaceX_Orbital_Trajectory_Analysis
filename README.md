SpaceX plans to accomplish the first interplanetary travel from Earth to Mars within this decade. Are they overly optimistic about their goals? Have they gathered all the information they needed to tackle this challenge? Are humans ready to inhabit on a completely new and unfamiliar planet?


There are countless unknown variables and infinitely-many more questions to consider. One thing for sure, is that there are aspects that can be answered from an engineering approach - one of which is how the trajectory path from Earth to Mars can be calculated. The departure time and arrival time can be now be estimated along with a cost function that determines how optimal the trajectory route is. A cost function can then be used to visualize the most optimal time frame to departure Earth and arrive Mars on the quickest and most efficient path.


TODO:
- Generate velocity vector with Battin-Loechler algorithm
- Generate earth-to-mars trajectory data 
- Visualizing a cost function with respect to trajectory
